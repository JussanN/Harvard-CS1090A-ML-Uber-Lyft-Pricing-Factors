# Most important factors influencing the price of Uber and Lyft rides in Boston
This is the final project for the Introduction to Data Science course (CS 1090A), part of the Masterâ€™s Program in Data Science at Harvard University. The project focuses on identifying the key factors that influence the pricing of Uber and Lyft rides in Boston.  

The goal of this project is to identify the most important factors influencing the price of Uber and Lyft rides in Boston by analyzing both rideshare data (e.g., distance, product type, surge pricing) and weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity). In other words, we want to find an answer to the question "What are the most important variables to determine price?"

We will use various machine learning models such as Multilinear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Boosting techniques to predict ride prices. To evaluate the models, we'll use cross-validation R2, a metric that shows how well the model's predictions match the actual ride prices. A higher R2 indicates better model performance, meaning the model explains more of the variation in price. We will select the best-performing model and use it to rank the features based on their importance in predicting price, helping to understand what drives pricing and providing actionable insights for optimization.

By applying this approach, we aim to uncover which variables, such as weather conditions, time of day, or distance, have the most significant impact on price, which can help rideshare companies to improve pricing strategies and resource allocation.
